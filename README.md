# Chess

This is a Chess Engine that I wrote to not be bad at chess. You can have it train to make better moves or can play against it [you can also use it to beat your friends :)]. It uses the Minimax Algorithm that is optimized with Alpha-Beta pruning and also has reward learning where it will make plays that are influenced by the success of the last time it made that play.
